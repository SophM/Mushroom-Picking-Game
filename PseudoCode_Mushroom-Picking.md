### Mushroom-Picking Game

1. Computer randomly "chooses" a number between 19 and 120, that the player has to match.

2. A random number (between 1 and 12) is assigned to 4 buttons. The buttons can, by chance, get the same number.

3. The player clicks on the buttons to try to match the number "chosen" by the computer.

4. Each time the player clicks on a button, the value of the button is added to the player's number. It's at this moment that she/he can know the value of the buttons.

6. If the player matches the number "chosen" by the computer, her/his wins increase by 1.

7. If the player goes over the number "chosen" by the computer, her/his losses increase by 1 point.

8. At the end of a round, a new random number is "chosen" by the computer and new random values are assigned to each button.

9. The player can start playing again.

10. Little adds-on: after a random number of clicks on the buttons (picked between 1 and 6), the player might be picking a "poisonous" mushroom or a "magic" mushroom when clicking on one of mushroom. 
    - if a "poisonous" mushroom is hiding and the player clicks on it, a message is displayed and new values will be attributed to the mushrooms.
    - if a "magic" mushroom is hiding and the player clicks on it, a message is displayed and the values of the mushrooms are revealed.
