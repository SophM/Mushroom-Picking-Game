# Mushroom-Picking Game

In this project, I built a mushroom-picking game, whose goal is for the player to match the number of harvested mushrooms displayed on the screen. In order to match this number, the player has to click on 4 different mushrooms. A value is attributed to each of the mushrooms. The player doesn't know those values at the beginning but can deduce them when she/he starts playing.

This game has a responsive layout and can be played on different devices!

I added two little features. At some point during the game, one of the mushrooms can become either:
- a "poisonous" mushroom. If the player clicks on it, a message will be displayed and new values will be assigned to the mushrooms.
- a "magic" mushroom. If the player clicks on it, a message will be displayed and the values of the mushroom will be revealed.

A round ends when the player matches the number of harvested mushrooms or when she/he goes over. At the end of a round, the game starts over automatically, everything is reset and a new number of harvested mushrooms to match is displayed on the screen.

To build this game, I used the following technologies:
- HTML
- jQuery
- CSS
- Bootstrap

Below are screenshots of the game.
